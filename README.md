# Rust Systems Portfolio — Robert Nio

Public‑safe artifacts for my Rust/Python systems & performance work. This repo powers a GitHub Pages site (from the `/docs` folder).

- **TTAPI (private)** — architecture one‑pager, demo plan, and engineering write‑ups
- Bench‑first & panic‑free Rust practices
- Links suitable for résumé/LinkedIn/Indeed

**Live site (once Pages is enabled):** https://githubrobbi.github.io/rust-systems-portfolio/

> The code for TTAPI is private; this repo hosts documentation and demo materials only.
